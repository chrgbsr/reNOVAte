# reNOVAte

### Nova Launcher deserves a second life.

---

Nova Launcher was the gold standard of Android launchers — fast, flexible, and endlessly customizable. Millions of users relied on it every day.

Then development stopped. Updates ended. Communication went silent.

But the community didn't move on.

## The Idea

**reNOVAte** is a community-driven, open-source effort to build a spiritual successor to Nova Launcher — one that's maintained by the people who actually use it.

Not a fork. Not a clone. A fresh start, built in the open, with the same philosophy that made Nova great:

- ⚡ **Performance first** — smooth, fast, lightweight
- 🎨 **Deep customization** — gestures, icon packs, layouts, themes
- 🔒 **Privacy-respecting** — no tracking, no data harvesting
- 📖 **Fully open-source** — every line of code, transparent

---

## Why This Matters

Great software shouldn't die because a company moves on. Android users deserve a launcher that's actively maintained, community-owned, and built with love.

Nova proved the concept. **reNOVAte** carries it forward.
