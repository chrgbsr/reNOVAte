# reNOVAte

### Nova Launcher deserves a second life.

## Background

Nova Launcher defined Android customization for nearly a decade. It was fast, deeply configurable, and trusted by millions of users who wanted full control over their home screen experience. For many, it wasn't just an app — it was the reason they chose Android.

After its acquisition in 2022, development slowed to a crawl. Updates became rare. Communication with the community stopped entirely. As Android evolved, Nova began falling behind — missing compatibility fixes, ignoring new platform features, and leaving long-standing bugs unresolved.

The app that once set the standard is now slowly becoming obsolete.

## What is reNOVAte?

**reNOVAte** is a community-driven initiative to build a modern, open-source Android launcher inspired by what made Nova Launcher great.

This is not a fork or a clone. It's a fresh effort, built from the ground up by the people who actually use launchers daily — developers, designers, testers, and enthusiasts who refuse to let the concept die.

The core principles:

- **Performance first** — a launcher should be the fastest app on your phone, not a resource hog. Sub-frame render times, minimal memory footprint, instant gesture response.
- **Deep customization** — gestures, icon packs, grid layouts, drawer organization, folder styles, widget placement, transition animations. Every detail should be user-configurable.
- **Privacy by design** — no telemetry, no analytics, no data collection. Your home screen is personal. It stays on your device.
- **Transparent development** — every line of code is open source. Every decision is discussed publicly. Every release is auditable.

## Why Open Source?

The failure of Nova Launcher illustrates a fundamental problem: when great software is owned by a single company, its fate depends on business decisions, not user needs. Acquisitions, pivots, and shifting priorities can kill a product overnight — regardless of how many people depend on it.

Open source solves this. No single entity controls the roadmap. No acquisition can shut it down. The community maintains it, improves it, and ensures it keeps pace with the platform.

Android's launcher space needs a credible open-source option. Not a hobby project that gets abandoned after six months, but a serious, well-maintained launcher backed by a real community. That's what reNOVAte aims to be.

## What We Need

This project is in its early stages. We're assembling a founding team of contributors across multiple disciplines:

| Role | Scope |
|------|-------|
| **Android Developers** | Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, launcher services, window management, performance profiling |
| **UI/UX Designers** | Interface design, interaction patterns, icon systems, theming architecture, Material You integration |
| **QA and Testers** | Device compatibility testing, regression testing, beta program management, bug triage |
| **Community and Docs** | Technical writing, API documentation, translations, community moderation, social outreach |

We're looking for people who use Android launchers seriously and want to shape what comes next. You don't need to commit full-time — even a few hours a week of focused contribution makes a difference.
